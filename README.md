# Predicting Car Prices using KNN


### Description
In this project, we will use the K-nearest neighbors algorithm to predict car's market price using its attributes. The data set we will be working with contains information on various cars, and its documentation can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile). There are four notebooks in this repo:
- Data Preparation;
- KNN using the train test validation method (guided project);
- KNN using the K-fold cross validation method;
- KNN using the LOOCV method.

### Objective
To practice KNN model tuning and validation methods.

### Skills
- Data Cleaning using pandas;
- Math operations with NumPy;
- Visualizations with matplotlib;
- KNN Regressor model building and Cross Validation methods using scikit-learn.
