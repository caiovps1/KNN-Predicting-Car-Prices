# Predicting Car Prices using KNN


### Description
In this project, we will use the K-nearest neighbors algorithm to predict car's market price using its attributes. The data set we will be working with contains information on various cars, and its documentation can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile).

### Objective
To practice KNN model tuning and validation methods.
